# Honeypots

This is an example of using honeypots with a Standalone model and a model with the Joomla CMS.
Note: The code has been tested with Joomla version 2.5, but it should be easy to adapt to other versions.

You can also see an example of a module for pH7CMS here: http://github.com/pH-7/fake-admin-honeypot-V1.1
